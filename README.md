# Steps to Run the Project Locally:
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository using Git. Navigate to the desired folder on your computer, open a terminal, and execute the git clone command followed by the repository link. Once cloned, move into the project directory using the cd command.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Inside the project directory, run npm install in the terminal to download and set up all the required dependencies for the project.

Start the Development Server: Use the command npm run dev to start the local development server. This will launch the project in development mode.

View the Project in the Browser: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You can now view and interact with the project locally.

Optional - Build for Production: If needed, you can build the project for production by running npm run build. Once built, start the production server using npm start. This will optimize the project for deployment.
